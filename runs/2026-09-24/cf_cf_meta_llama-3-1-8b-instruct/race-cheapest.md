## Attempts

### Attempt 1 (FAIL)

```almide
effect fn cheapest_probe(costs: List[Int]) -> Int = {
  fan.race(costs, (x) => {
    let result = probe(x)
    if result % 2 == 0 then ok(result) else err("probe returned odd value")
  }) ?? -1
}

fn probe(n: Int) -> Int = {
  var i = 0
  var acc = 0
  while i < n { acc = (acc + i * 7) % 999983; i = i + 1 }
  acc
}
```

**Diagnostic:**

```
